                        Grom is an Epic Brawler who could be unlocked early for a limited time by winning the Grom Challenge or can be obtained from the Starr Road. He has moderately low health and a high damage potential. He attacks by throwing his walkie-talkie over obstacles that explodes in a cross pattern upon contact.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">
                        His Super is a larger bomb that explodes into four larger projectiles in a cross pattern that can destroy obstacles and knock enemies back. His first Gadget, Watchtower, drops a watchtower that allows Grom and allies to see inside of bushes within its radius. His second Gadget, Radio Check, makes Grom's next attack throw 3 walkie-talkies. Grom’s first Star Power, Foot Patrol, boosts Grom's movement speed when his Super is charged. Grom’s second Star Power, X-Factor, increases his attack damage the farther they split.

The turret has 1500 health, will be destroyed if Grom deploys another turret, and decays by 75 health per second until it's destroyed, lasting for up to 20 seconds if it doesn’t take any damage. Any invisible enemies like Leon or Sandy inside the turret's radius will not be revealed.
